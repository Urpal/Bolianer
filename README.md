# Bolianer
Bolianer is a project for monitoring the available furniture that is on sale on Bolia. They have a lot of bargains throughout the seasons, but it is hard to monitor this by one self. This project is deployed using Databutton or similar where an e-mail notification can be set up for specific products at different nearby locations.

## Use
See [Bolianer at Databutton](https://databutton.com/v/9amdy4g2) for deployed modules using Databutton.

## TODO
This project will soon be deployed using Heroku or similar as a stand alone web app.

Happy furnituring :)
